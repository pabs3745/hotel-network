# Hotel Local Area Network (LAN) Implementation - Cisco Packet Tracer

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Local Area Network (LAN) for a multi-floor hotel using Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT). The hotel's network infrastructure comprises three floors: ground floor, first floor, and second floor, each containing rooms with specific purposes. The network elements, including PCs, IP phones, and printers, are interconnected through switches, and all switches are further linked with a common router that provides connectivity on each floor. Proper IP addressing has been configured for each sector of the network, ensuring seamless communication and optimal functionality. The entire network setup is virtually simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT), leveraging the technology of Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA).
